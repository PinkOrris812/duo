# Duolingo "Prove Your Love" Campaign

This repository contains the implementation of a two-week co-creation campaign for Duolingo called "Prove Your Love," which challenges users to demonstrate their devotion through action rather than words with the tagline "*Miss me? Prove it*."

## Overview

Building on the momentum of Duolingo's viral "Duo's death" campaign, this project invites users to submit phrases about love in their mother tongue that Duolingo supports. Other users can rate submissions, and the top-voted phrases will be featured in the app with contributor credits.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page with submission form
- `gallery.html` - Voting gallery for user submissions
- `assets/` - Contains CSS, JS, and image files
- `database/` - SQL setup scripts for database architecture
- `api/` - Backend API endpoints for submissions and votes

## Features

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Social media integration
